# Portfolio for my work

https://learicist.com

Here is my main Website. This is something I have been working on for years now, and continue to add to and update as the content within it changes. My most recent change was a large overhaul to bring the project modern using Bootstrap 5.

You can find examples of both my Coding work  [ learicist.com/webDev.html ]  as well as my Musical endeavors  [ learicist.com/music.html ] within.

I hope you enjoy!
